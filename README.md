What is this?
-----------------

I love Netbeans and I love Sublime Text 2. Also, I love saving time
while I code using autocomplete. The problem is that the Netbeans 
Java code templates are different of Sublime Text 2 Java snippets.

Because I don't want to remember two different shortcuts to do the same,
I have adapted the Java Netbeans code templates to work at Sublime 
Text 2.

Requirements
------------

I've only tested the snippets at Sublime Text 2 first beta. Maybe they
works on Sublime Text 1 and/or Textmate.

Installation
------------

Copy the JavaNetbeans folder in your Sublime Text 2 installation
Packages folder.

Ubuntu Sublime Text 2 Packages folder: $HOME/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages 

Documentation
-------------

The code templates adapted are documented here:
